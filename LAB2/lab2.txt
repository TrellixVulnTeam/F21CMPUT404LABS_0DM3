Q2:
The server socket in python is used to associate with a port using bind(),then wait to listen client connection and receive the data sending from client
The client socket is used to connect the server and send request

Q3:
When we set options for the socket, use a parameter flag socket.SO_REUSEADDR to tell the kernel to reuse a local socket in TIME_WAIT state


Q4:
We could get the property of client socket by looking into the 'conn' and host address with port number about incoming connections by looking into 'addr'


Q5:
the recv() returns the response header from the external host within the maximum byte as the BUFFER_SIZE. The exceed part will be cut off.
